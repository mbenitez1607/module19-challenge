## Description

J.A.T.E. (Just Another Text Editor) is a text editor that runs in the browser.

The content in the text editor is saved through the use of IndexedDB, thus when the app is reopened, after closing it,
the content in the text editor is retrieved from the local IndexedDB.

The app can also be installed locally to your device by clicking on the Install button. This will download the web application as an icon on the desktop.
